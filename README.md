# CellularAutomata
 A cool cellular automata implementation in GMS 2.3


## Features:
- A fun little sandbox
- 10 types of cells
- Almost all of them have a specific interaction with at least one of the others
- 960x540 room, 8100 cells
- Painting with variable brush size

## List of cells
- Air (empty)
- Stone (just a solid block)
- Fire (sets things on fire)
- Wood (a solid block that is flameable)
- Sand (affected by gravity, fills any liquids)
- Water (affected by gravity, flows, makes steam on contact with Fire)
- Steam (flies upwards)
- Gunpowder (like sand, but extremely flameable)
- Plant (solid. flameable, grows by consuming water)
- Acid (dissolves some things. makes Steam on contact with water. also is flameable)
- Ash (wip)
